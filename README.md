Measuring access to contraceptive methods among ethnic groups using Small Area Estimation

Abstract
Ensuring universal access to Sexual and Reproductive Rights (SRR) is the target 5.6 of the SDG. One of the limitations to designing policies that facilitate access to safe, effective, and affordable contraceptive methods for ethnic women is the lack of information among local governments. To address this gap, we use Small Areas Estimation not on geographic areas but on population groups, with the 2015-DHS and 2018 Census. We compute indicators for married or in-a-union women at the ethnic level in Colombian states, including the percentage of women using contraceptive methods and those related to unmet contraception needs.

We find that ethnicity itself is not a determinant for contraceptive use; instead, socio-economic characteristics play a role. However, the interaction between ethnicity and having a partner from the same ethnic group significantly decreases the probability of contraceptive use. This is attributed to cultural traditions, as in many ethnic communities, the decisions about contraception often depend on men.

The estimations reveal a direct relationship between the percentage of the ethnic population and the ethnic gap in SRR indicators at the state level. The results highlight the need for targeted interventions to decrease this gap, which include the involvement of womenâ€™s partners and communities.
